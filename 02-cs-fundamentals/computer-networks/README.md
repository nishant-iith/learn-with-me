# Computer Networks

Computer networking concepts, protocols, layers, and security.

## Study Timeline
**Month 3** (With Node.js)

## Resources

### Primary Resource (Book - Modern)
**[High Performance Browser Networking (HPBN)](https://hpbn.co/)**

**Why:** Most colleges teach the "OSI Model" from the 90s. This book teaches TCP/UDP/TLS/HTTP in the context of modern Web Apps (crucial for Node.js goals).

**Available:** Free online

### Supplementary Resource (Video - Basics)
**[Neso Academy - Computer Networks](https://www.youtube.com/@nesoacademy)**

**Usage:** Watch the first 10-15 videos to understand:
- OSI Model
- IP Addressing
- Subnetting

---

## Key Topics

### Network Fundamentals
- **OSI Model:** 7 layers of network architecture
- **TCP/IP Model:** Modern 4-layer model
- **IP Addressing:** IPv4, IPv6, subnetting
- **Routing:** Algorithms and protocols

### Transport Layer
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
  - Connection-oriented communication
  - Flow control and congestion control
  - Reliable data transfer
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
  - Connectionless communication
  - Fast, lightweight protocol

### Application Layer Protocols
- **HTTP/1.1:** Traditional web protocol
- **HTTP/2:** Multiplexing and server push
- **HTTP/3:** QUIC protocol
- **WebSockets:** Real-time bidirectional communication
- **DNS:** Domain Name System

### Security
- **TLS/SSL:** Transport Layer Security
- **HTTPS:** Secure HTTP
- **Encryption:** Symmetric and asymmetric
- **Authentication:** Certificates and handshakes

### Performance
- **Latency vs Bandwidth**
- **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)**
- **Caching strategies**
- **Load balancing**

## Connection to Node.js

You cannot understand Backend (Node.js) without understanding HTTP/TCP:
- TCP connections → WebSocket servers
- HTTP protocol → Express.js routing
- Request/Response → API design
- TLS/SSL → HTTPS servers
- DNS → Domain management
- Performance optimization → Backend scalability

## Topics to Focus On

### For Backend Development:
1. **TCP/IP:** How data travels across the internet
2. **HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2:** Protocol differences and performance
3. **REST API Design:** Using HTTP methods correctly
4. **WebSockets:** Real-time features
5. **TLS/HTTPS:** Securing your applications
