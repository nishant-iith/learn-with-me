# Operating Systems

Operating systems concepts, processes, memory management, and scheduling.

## Study Timeline
**Month 1** (With C++ Memory Phase)

## Resources

### Primary Resource (Book)
**[OSTEP (Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces)](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)**
- Free, industry-standard textbook
- Reads like a story, not a manual
- Focus: Virtualization (CPU/Memory) and Concurrency

### Supplementary Resource (Video)
**[Gate Smashers OS Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/@GateSmashers)**
- Use when stuck on concepts
- Excellent for visualizing algorithms (Round Robin, Paging, etc.)

## Key Topics

### Virtualization
- **Processes:** Process creation, states, and lifecycle
- **Threads:** Multithreading and concurrency
- **Context Switching:** CPU scheduling and process management
- **Memory Management:** Virtual memory, paging, segmentation

### Concurrency
- **Thread Synchronization:** Locks, semaphores, monitors
- **Deadlocks:** Detection, prevention, and avoidance
- **Race Conditions:** Critical sections and mutual exclusion

## Connection to C++

Learning Pointers in C++ helps you understand "Virtual Memory" in OS - they are the same concept:
- Memory addresses in C++ → Virtual addresses in OS
- Pointers and references → Memory management
- Dynamic allocation → Heap management
- Stack frames → Call stack visualization

## Notes

_Your OS notes will go here as you progress through the material._
