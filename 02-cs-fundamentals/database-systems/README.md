# Database Systems

Database management systems, SQL, normalization, transactions, and indexing.

## Study Timeline
**Month 2** (With C++ OOPS Phase)

## Resources

### Primary Resource (Video - Advanced)
**[CMU 15-445: Intro to Database Systems](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/)** (Andy Pavlo)

**Warning:** This is hard. It teaches you how to **build** a database, not just use one.

**Focus Lectures:**
- **01-06:** Architecture, Storage, Buffer Pools
- **16-18:** Concurrency Control

### Supplementary Resource (Video - Basics)
**[Gate Smashers DBMS Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/@GateSmashers)**
- SQL queries and operations
- Normalization: 2NF, 3NF, BCNF
- Basic database concepts

## Key Topics

### Database Architecture
- Storage engines and file organization
- Buffer pool management
- Index structures (B-Trees, B+ Trees)

### Normalization
- **1NF:** First Normal Form - Atomic values
- **2NF:** Second Normal Form - Eliminate partial dependencies
- **3NF:** Third Normal Form - Eliminate transitive dependencies
- **BCNF:** Boyce-Codd Normal Form - Advanced normalization

### SQL
- Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Joins, subqueries, and aggregations
- Query optimization

### Transactions & Concurrency
- ACID properties
- Isolation levels
- Locking mechanisms
- Deadlock handling

### Indexing
- B-Tree and B+ Tree structures
- Hash indexing
- Clustered vs non-clustered indexes
- Index selection and optimization

## Connection to C++ OOPS

Understanding "Classes" helps you understand "Tables" and "Schema Design":
- Classes → Tables
- Objects → Rows/Records
- Attributes → Columns
- Methods → Stored Procedures
- Inheritance → Table relationships
- Encapsulation → Data integrity constraints
