# Rules for ML LaTeX Book - Comprehensive Guidelines

## 1. Target Audience
- **Primary Reader**: 16-year-old first-year college student.
- **Assumption**: Reader has NO prior knowledge of Machine Learning.
- **Tone**: Friendly but professional. No slang, no emojis.
- **Goal**: The reader should be able to understand the material WITHOUT a professor.

## 2. Content Depth and Flow
- **Smooth Transitions**: Every section must logically connect to the previous one. Use phrases like "Building on the previous concept...", "Recall that we learned...".
- **Multiple Intuitions**: Explain every major concept using at least TWO different approaches:
    1. **Real-World Analogy** (e.g., "Imagine a seesaw for balance...")
    2. **Geometric/Visual Intuition** (e.g., "Picture a line on a graph...")
    3. **Mathematical Derivation** (step-by-step, never skip steps)
- **No Assumptions**: Define every term before using it. Use `\begin{definition}...\end{definition}` blocks.
- **HOTS Questions**: Include critical thinking questions at the end of key sections.

## 3. Chapter Structure Template
Each chapter MUST follow this structure:
1.  **Introduction**: What is the problem? Why does it matter?
2.  **Intuition**: Explain with a story/analogy.
3.  **Mathematical Formulation**: Define the equations clearly.
4.  **Worked Example**: Solve a problem by hand (step-by-step).
5.  **Code Implementation**: Provide Python/Scikit-Learn code with explanations.
6.  **Visualization**: Include a TikZ/PGFPlots figure OR an image from `assets/`.
7.  **Summary/Key Takeaways**: Bulleted list of main points.
8.  **HOTS Questions**: 2-3 interview-style or thought-provoking questions.

## 4. LaTeX Rules
- **No Syntax Errors**: Compile and check the log before finalizing.
- **Consistent Notation**:
    - Weights: $w$, Bias: $b$, Learning Rate: $\eta$ or $\alpha$.
    - Vectors: Lowercase bold ($\mathbf{x}$) or $w^T x$.
    - Matrices: Uppercase bold ($\mathbf{X}$).
- **Definitions**: Use `\begin{definition}...\end{definition}` for key terms.
- **Code Blocks**: Use `lstlisting` environment with `language=Python`.
- **Figures**: Use `\begin{figure}[htbp]...\end{figure}` with captions and labels.
- **TikZ/PGFPlots**: Prefer for conceptual diagrams. Use `\begin{tikzpicture}...\end{tikzpicture}`.
- **Existing Images**: Copy from `02-supervised/assets/` to `book/figures/` and use `\includegraphics`.

## 5. Code Examples
- Provide as many code examples as possible.
- **Step-by-step Explanation**: Add numbered comments in code.
- Use standard libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`.
- Always include `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`.
- Always show sample output (accuracy, plot, etc.) in comments or text.

## 6. Image and Asset Usage
- Check `02-supervised/assets/` for existing images first.
- Copy relevant images to `book/figures/` before including.
- For conceptual plots (scatter, line, bar), prefer TikZ/PGFPlots.

## 7. Mistakes Log (Add entries as they occur)
- **[2026-01-02]**: Using `**text**` for bold in LaTeX is invalid. Use `\textbf{text}`.
- **[2026-01-02]**: `uber thick` is not a valid TikZ style. Use `ultra thick` or `very thick`.
- **[2026-01-02]**: Avoid placing `axis` environment inside another `tikzpicture` without proper `at` positioning.
- **[2026-01-02]**: Always check `ml_book.log` tail for errors after compilation.
